# Android Calendar Plugin for PhoneGap #

This plugin is tested on Gingerbread (Samsung Galaxy S2) and Jellybean. Since there is no official Calendar API before Ice Cream Sandwich, your mileage may vary for older Androids.

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

Either:

1. Copy `calendar.js` to your project's `www` folder and include a reference to it in your html files.
2. Create `src/com/twist/android/plugins/calendar` in your project and move the java files into it.

Or use pluginstall: https://github.com/alunny/pluginstall

## JavaScript API ##

This plugin attempts to confirm to the W3C Calendar API (http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/calendar/). Currently only `findEvents` is implemented.

Get the plugin object with `cordova.require('cordova/plugin/calendar')`.

### findEvents ###
`findEvents(successCb, errorCb, filter)`

Find calendar events from active calendars.

```js
var later = new Date();
later.setDate(later.getDate() + 3); // 3 days from now
  
cordova.require('cordova/plugin/calendar').findEvents(function(events) {
  // Do something with returned events array.
}, function() {
  // There's an error for some reason.
}, {
  'summary': 'Test'
  'startAfter': new Date().getTime(),
  'startBefore': later.getTime()
});
```
